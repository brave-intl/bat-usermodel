Yankees manager Joe Girardi meets the media on Monday night after New York tied its ALDS series with Cleveland, 2-2, after a 7-3 win. Chris Sale was the best pitcher in the American League for most of 2017. Craig Kimbrel has been the best closer in baseball.   Yet after this long, rainy afternoon led to stinging season-ending defeat for the Red Sox, the most important question is not who is best. It is this: If a team is going... NEW YORK — Luis Severino bounced back from his playoff debacle, slumping Aaron Judge delivered a big hit and the New York Yankees took advantage of shoddy defense by Cleveland to beat the Indians 7-3 Monday night and push their AL Division Series to a decisive Game 5.   Gary Sanchez homered and Judge... BOSTON — Ace left-hander Chris Sale began Boston's AL Division Series by giving up seven runs in five innings. Fellow starters Drew Pomeranz, Doug Fister and Rick Porcello didn't do any better.   Again and again, the high-powered Houston Astros got to Boston's starters early, and after four truncated... Masahiro Tanaka's seven-inning gem was saved when Aaron Judge prevented a home run in right field, and Greg Bird homered to give the New York Yankees a 1-0 victory over the Cleveland Indians in Game 3 on Sunday night, extending their AL Division Series.   Aroldis Chapman got a five-out save as New... Hanley Ramirez waved a ""Believe in Boston"" flag during pregame introductions, drawing cheers from a Fenway Park crowd fearful of a second straight postseason sweep.   Then he gave the Red Sox exactly what they wished for: more October baseball.   ""I just tried to wake everybody up,"" Ramirez said after... NEW YORK — After a crushing loss, Yankees manager Joe Girardi spent the night pondering his decision not to challenge a critical hit-by-pitch call during a game-changing sixth inning.   His verdict?   ""I screwed up.""   Girardi took the blame Saturday after his call not to challenge possibly shifted the... BOSTON — If the Boston Red Sox are nervous about the possibility of being swept out of the playoffs for the second straight year, they were trying hard not to show it on Saturday.   A year after losing in David Ortiz's final game and being eliminated 3-0 by the Cleveland Indians in the AL Division... CLEVELAND – Two bullpen stalwarts that helped save the Yankees in Tuesday's wild card game experienced a shocking collapse Friday night.   As a result the Yankees absorbed one of the most brutal postseason losses in recent memory, falling 9-8 in 13 innings at a rocking Progressive Field.   The Indians,... HOUSTON — Carlos Correa, Jose Altuve and the high-powered Astros led the majors in runs, hits and batting average in the regular season.   Now that it's playoff time, Houston is still hammering away.   Correa homered, doubled and drove in four runs, Altuve got two more hits and the Astros battered... CLEVELAND — Trevor Bauer made Aaron Judge look silly, and made his manager look like a genius.   One year after nearly costing the Indians a trip to the World Series, Bauer helped them take the first step back.   Named a surprise starter for Game 1, Bauer chopped Judge and New York's other big bats... Jose Altuve hit three home runs in an unprecedented show of power for the diminutive major league batting champion as the Houston Astros roughed up Chris Sale and the Boston Red Sox 8-2 Thursday in Game 1 of the AL Division Series.   Buoyed by chants of ""MVP"" in each trip to the plate, the 5-foot-6... Five former UConn baseball players were employed by playoff teams at the outset of this MLB postseason. That output matched prospect factories like Rice and LSU, and only two schools — Virginia and Arizona State — had more, with seven each.   A few caveats: Red Sox reserve outfielder Rajai Davis,...
